Overlay functions referenced in exe: Title, Loading, Options, Atlas, Credits.

There are likely cases of scans which use main instead of main_TEXT_START, this should really be changed long-term.

In addition, (at least some of) the 80074dec and 8007EC9C references in initialise should actually be title_text and title_data.
However, as there's already a decomp.me instance for this, it may not be important to change right now.

The unused symbols file should be checked for any references to any artificial variables that are now no longer present.

Additionally, these are weird:

* According to Ghidra, DAT_80076e08 (and some others in the area), DAT_80078b18, and  DAT_8007c718 are called by the credits overlay.
  I haven't seen any obvious place in any overlay that these are supposed to be pointing to, but they seem to be pointing to some
  level data loaded relative to the end of the credits overlay.
