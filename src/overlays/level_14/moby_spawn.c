 * MobySpawn_level_14() - func_level_14_8007C69C() - MATCHING
 * Most recent MobySpawn as of 2025-08-21
 * Need to figure out if v2 should be included / use defines, if I put it in it messes up some of the stack usage
 * Note that level 13 will be added first, so when this is added I should check any tags / content for accuracy
